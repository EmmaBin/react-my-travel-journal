The reason why we love it so much for several facts: 1, Passengers are nice and friendly. I vividly recalled when we landed, all passengers folded their blanks nicely as if no one were sitting there. 2, Food and shopping, even room service is so much better than other places.",

When I was sightseeing this city, it did look like a birthplace for so many moving stories.
